# Image Clustering
- imagehash
    - aHash, pHash, dHash, wHash
    - try with low values of hash size
- lib puzzle
    - visual bag-of-words approach for feature extraction?
- other feature extraction methods?
    - color-based
    - texture-based: Gabor
    - more advanced : SIFT/SURF
- Focus on feature extraction which will be more important than the algorithm (k-means vs SVM vs LSH?)
