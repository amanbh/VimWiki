- One of the most popular approaches to unsupervised learning of complicated distributions.
- Generate synthetic samples from the distribution of given samples.
- Assuming some latent variables that are forced to have Gaussian distribution.

- NTS: Any distribution in d dimensions can be generated by taking a set of d variables
  that are normally distributed and mapping them through a sufficiently complicated
  function.
