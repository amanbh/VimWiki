    - One of the most popular approaches to unsupervised learning of complicated distributions.
    - Generate synthetic samples from the distribution of given samples.
    - Assuming some latent variables that are forced to have Gaussian distribution.

    - NTS: Any distribution in d dimensions can be generated by taking a set of d variables
      that are normally distributed and mapping them through a sufficiently complicated
      function.
